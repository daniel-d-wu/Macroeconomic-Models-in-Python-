# MacroFinance-Models-in-Python-

In the Finance and Economics academic literature, the "equity premium puzzle" refers to a mismatch between standard neoclassical economics and the observed US equity return over the past 70~ years. This concept was introduced by Mehra and Prescott (1985), in which they show the average observed equity premium (over bonds) of 6% can be rationalized only with an absurdly high level of risk aversion. Since then, this puzzle has spawned a huge literature in both Economics and Finance that borrow techniques from Macroeconomics to explain why we observe a 6% equity premium at the aggregate economy level. Two "contemporary" explanations inspired by Mehra and Prescott (1985) are Rare Disasters (Barro, 2006, 2009) and Long Run Risk (Bansal and Yaron 2004). In this file, I replicate the approach taken by Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Bansal and Yaron (2004) in Python, and encourage interested viewers to do one for the Rare Disaster model.   

## 1. mp_compute.ipynb
      This file builds the Mehra and Prescott (1985) model. 

## 2. mp_compile.ipynb
      This file compiles the code from the previous file and produces tables of parameter values.
      The insight of this model is that risk aversion is calibrated to be ~15 (very high) in order to achieve an equity premium of 6-7%.

      This file builds the Bansal and Yaron (2004) Long Run Risk Model.
